# InfoStealer-By-Me-Using-Pythom


# 🦠 Malware InfoStealer (Educational Project)

> ⚠️ This project was created **strictly for educational purposes**.  
> It was developed and tested in an isolated virtual environment to explore malware behavior and data extraction techniques.

## 🔍 Description

A Python-based simulation of a simple "info-stealer" malware script.  
It mimics the behavior of basic malware by attempting to read stored user data (like browser credentials, cookies, or saved files) from a local environment.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how info-stealers work
- Learn about system access, file extraction, and obfuscation
- Practice safe, ethical cybersecurity learning in a controlled setup

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech

- Python 3  
- VirtualBox / VMware for safe testing  
- OS: Windows 10 (inside VM)

## 📁 Note

This code was **never deployed on a real machine**, only in sandboxed VMs.  
It’s intended for **students interested in ethical hacking & malware analysis**.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

I do **not condone** malicious activity. This project is purely educational.
